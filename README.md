A Slider component based on the native html5 range input.

The component itself takes on a number value between two bounds, that
proceeds in discrete step values. So, for example, to indicate a
percentage of saturation in an image, where the smallest change in
saturation is 1%, you might specify your slider control like:

```handlebars
{{x-range-input min=0 max=100 step=1 value=saturationPercentage action=(action "updateSaturation")}}
```

In this example we would need to implement an `updateSaturation` action that
sets the value of `saturationPercentage`. That might look something like this:


```js
actions: {
  updateSaturation(value) {
    this.set('saturationPercentage', value);
  }
}
```
The `action` sends two arguments with it. The first is the value and the
second is the component itself as an optional argument.


### Default Values

While `min`, `max`, and `step` can take on any numeric values, the
default use-case is optimized for representing percentages stepped by
1%. There fore the proceeding example could have been written simply
as:

```handlebars
{{x-range-input value=saturationPercentage action=(action "updateSaturation")}}
```

### Classic "binding style" with the `mut` helper

```handlebars
{{x-range-input value=(mut saturationPercentage)}}
```
